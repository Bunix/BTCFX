<h2 class="title">Using the Contractor’s Web App</h2>

<p>The aim of the app is to allow you to communicate your availability in real time to the office. Hopefully, this will allow you to incorporate the jobs we pass you with your other commitments. Thereby reducing customer complaints for late or non attendance.</p>

<p>When you first sign in you will need to select the services you want to offer. If you don’t activate a service you won’t be considered for those jobs. Over time it will calculate the average time taken for each job so that we can provide estimates to customers.</p>

<p>Once you have activated some services the schedule page will become available. Each day is split into four sections: Morning (9am -12pm), Lunchtime (12pm – 3pm), Afternoon (3pm – 6pm)  and Evening (6pm – 9pm). If you want to assigned jobs then increase your availability by clicking the up arrow in the relevant section. If you take bookings from another source, so your availability changes, simply reduce your availability by clicking the down arrow.</p>

<p>Each day, every section starts with zero availability. Therefore, you must actively indicate that you wish to be assigned jobs.  You can adjust your schedule up to 3 days in advance.</p>

<p>We understand that plumbing is an unpredictable business, that jobs can often take longer than first expected. Therefore, if you do get stuck on a job, simply reduce your availability for the rest of the day. If you’ve already accepted jobs that you can’t do (or will be significantly late for), you must contact the office ASAP so the job can be reassigned.</p>

<p>We will be releasing weekly updates to the app so that soon you can accept jobs online and submit invoices etc., but for now Maria will text or phone you when a job comes in. In the future you will be able adjust your minimum hourly rate for each type of job, so that when you are quiet you can decrease your rate to attract my customers and vice versa. More details on these features coming soon.</p>
